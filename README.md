# Premake5-SnakeGame-in-C++
Horrific code i made 

To compile u need to cd into the directory and run 
premake5 gmake
then run
make clean all
or execute relevant script in the scripts folder with .sh ./name

if ur on windows use file explorer go into directory and click where the directory shows and add /cmd at the end.
/example/project/directory/cmd

then when cmd shows up run premake5 gmake then
make clean all
